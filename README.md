# CodKiller Game Engine Documentation (Alpha Version)
Introduction
CodKiller is a game engine designed to facilitate the development of 2D games with features such as map editing, rendering, and agent behavior. This documentation provides an overview of the engine's functionality and usage instructions for the alpha version.
Features
The CodKiller game engine offers the following features:

Javascript has evolved into a language capable of handling realtime 3D graphics, 
via WebGL, and computationally intensive tasks such as physics simulations.
These types of applications demand high performance vector and matrix math,
which is something that Javascript doesn't provide by default.
glMatrix to the rescue!

glMatrix is designed to perform vector and matrix operations stupidly fast! By
hand-tuning each function for maximum performance and encouraging efficient
usage patterns through API conventions, glMatrix will help you get the most out
of your browsers Javascript engine.

For a tutorial, see [the "introducing glMatrix" section of _Introduction to Computer Graphics_ by David J. Eck](http://math.hws.edu/graphicsbook/c7/s1.html#webgl3d.1.2)

For a babel plugin to make writing the API nicer, see [babel-plugin-transfrom-gl-matrix](https://github.com/akira-cn/babel-plugin-transform-gl-matrix)

Regarding the current performance in modern web browsers, calling `glMatrix.setMatrixArrayType(Array)` to use normal arrays instead of Float32Arrays can greatly increase the performance.

5. Implement the update method of the Agent class to define the behavior of the agents. This method should update the agent's position and state based on its velocity and awareness.

6. Implement the draw method of the Agent class to visually represent the agents on the canvas.

7. Start the rendering loop by calling the startRendering method of the Map instance.
Limitations
The alpha version of CodKiller has the following limitations:

1. Untested: The alpha version has not been thoroughly tested, so there may be bugs or unexpected behavior.

2. Basic Functionality: The engine provides basic functionality for map editing, rendering, and agent behavior. Advanced features such as collision detection, user input handling, and game logic are not included in this version.

3. Limited Documentation: The documentation provided for the alpha version is limited to the features and usage instructions features and usage instructions. More detailed documentation will be provided in future versions.


#Conclusion
The CodKiller game engine is a promising tool for developing 2D games with map editing, rendering, and agent behavior capabilities. While the alpha version has limitations and is untested, it serves as a foundation for further development and refinement.

Please note that this documentation only covers the alpha version of CodKiller. As the engine evolves, additional features, improvements, and bug fixes will be introduced. Stay tuned for future updates and releases.

If you have any questions, encounter issues, or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy game development with CodKiller!
