#Wall Class Documentation

The Wall class represents a wall object in the CodKiller game engine. Walls are used to define the boundaries and obstacles within the game environment. This documentation provides an overview of the Wall class and its properties.
Class Signature
## Constructor
Parameters
- startPoint (object): The starting point of the wall, specified as an object with x and y coordinates.
- endPoint (object): The ending point of the wall, specified as an object with x and y coordinates.
- height (number): The height of the wall.
- color (string): The color of the wall.
Description
The constructor initializes a new instance of the Wall class with the provided parameters. It sets the startPoint, endPoint, height, and color properties of the wall.
Methods
### draw(ctx, disappearingPoint, userViewPosition)
Parameters
- ctx (CanvasRenderingContext2D): The 2D rendering context of the canvas.
- disappearingPoint (object): The disappearing point of the 3D rendering effect, specified as an object with x and y coordinates.
- userViewPosition (object): The position of the user's view, specified as an object with x and y coordinates.
Description
The draw method is responsible for rendering the wall on the canvas. It takes the rendering context ctx, the disappearing point disappearingPoint, and the user's view position userViewPosition as parameters.

Inside the draw method, the wall is rendered using the provided rendering context. The position and height of the wall are adjusted based on the user's view position and the disappearing point to create a 3D effect.
Example Usage
This example demonstrates how to create a new instance of the Wall class and render it on the canvas using the draw method.

Please note that the draw method assumes the availability of a 2D rendering context (ctx), a disappearing point (disappearingPoint), and the user's view position (userViewPosition).
Conclusion
The Wall class in the CodKiller game engine provides a convenient way to represent and render walls within the game environment. By utilizing the startPoint, endPoint, height, and color properties, developers can create visually appealing and interactive walls in their games.
