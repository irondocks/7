After adding the wall, you can redraw the map to reflect the changes.",
    "The `drawMap` function is responsible for rendering the map on the canvas. It clears the canvas, then iterates over the `agents`, `user`, and `walls` objects in the `map` data structure. It uses the properties of these objects to draw rectangles on the canvas, representing the agents, user, and walls.",
    "To implement the jump function for the character, you can add a jump command in the text input event listener. When the user enters the jump command, you can update the position of the character on the canvas to simulate a jump. This can be done by modifying the `y` coordinate of the character's position and redrawing the map.",
    "The logic behind the agent movement in the game is not provided in the code snippet you shared. It would depend on the specific requirements and rules of the game.
